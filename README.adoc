This bot will start out with telegram, but may expand to allow for e-mail
subscription requests for newsletters, price updates, and reports.

## Proposed Commands

### Live request triggers community

* `/price` gets a pair price
* `/pool` gets the pool information
* `/scam` as reply to a message will check our database and search for the
  message content, maybe is a fake contract.
** It can take an option that the
   report also bans the author from all channels with our bot. User will receive
   a message in which they can open a support ticket to remove the ban.

### Announcement and Subscript Functionality

* `/subscribe` can suscribe to a pair and start receiving price notifications
* `/alerts` can subscribe to a pair and receive alerts, like liquidity draining
* `/remind` sends periodic messages to the channel
* `/twitter` can subscribe to a twitter user and share his tweets (good to gain RT)

## Development

As we know what is needed to build the commands, we will write that in Postman
so the platform team can get those connections done. Meaning, the API's will be
developed to accommodate what is wanted here.
